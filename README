Contact Management System
-------------------------
For a very long time now, I have had the need for a contact management system.
My needs are simple and modest, and I don't think that it is worth purchasing 
a product like ACT or anything else like that.  Instead, I would like to build one
from the ground up, that way I know how it works, and it also gives the me the opportunity
to develop in Groovy/Grails (a language that I am hoping to use more in the future)
